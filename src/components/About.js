                    I'm currently a third year student at Oregon State University studying Computer Science. 
                    Since high school, I became interested in programming with a focus in software engineering.
                    I'm excited that I have the opportunity to explore the many incredible things that can be done with coding.
                    In the meantime, I've been working on side projects to learn new tools and technologies which you can check out below!
